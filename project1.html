                            In this portfolio, A group project will be discussed in detail with a focus on selection of the correct tools to build an artifact.
                            <br>
                            <b>The Artifact</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For this Project a scaled version of a head with the following features:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A head with a hinged panel for access at the back.</li>
                                <li>Skin like look to create a finish.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The artifact is inspired by the 1997 series of Men In Black(MIB), where Rosenberg is revealed as a Mechanical human controlled by an alien.
                            <img src="/md/mibrosenberg.png" alt="MIB Rosenberg.">
                            <br>
                            Due to design and cost constraints, a few changes in approach have been made.
                            The opening will be designed to allow access from the back of the head. This will meet further requirements of the project.
                            The second addition will focus on creating eye movement. If the budget and time allow,
                            an additional goal could be to add a speaker to play songs or speech.

                    <h4>Reverse Engineering</h4>
                    <p>
                    The Head for the model will be Michael Alcock(The Author) <i>pictured in Fig. 1</i>.
                    Designing a head from scratch in a CAD or sculpting software would take a long time and potentially miss out features.
                    For this reason a method of reverse engineering the object was required.   
                    <br><img src="/md/michael_head_front.png" alt="Michael Alcock's head">
                    <figcaption><i>Fig. 1 - Michael Alcock's head profile picture</i></figcaption>
                    </p>
                    <p>Two scanners were trialled for the task. The first is a HandySCAN 3D Black Series from creaform3d.com
                    <i>pictured in Fig.2</i>. This is a handheld unit that uses lasers to measure distance to the object and records the 
                    changes in shape as it moves across the surface. The measurement rate is incredibly fast at 1.3mil/s. 
                    and an accuracy of 0.025mm.</P>
                    <img src="/md/handyscan_black_elite.png" alt="creaform3d">
                    <figcaption><i>Fig 2. - https://www.creaform3d.com/en/portable-3d-scanner-handyscan-3d</i></figcaption>
                    <p>The HandySCAN requires the object to use a method of location. 
                        These are reflective markers that increase the accuracy and allow the laser to map an area. 
                        These markers are best placed in a random format.
                        The main limitation of the HandySCAN is it cannot deal with hair. Which is an issue for modelling heads. 
                        This is demonstrated in <i>Fig 3.</i> using Michael Alcock's head.</p>
                    <img src="/md/handyscan_black_elite.png" alt="creaform3d">
                    <figcaption><i>Fig 3. - Laser reflectors used for mapping surface areas.</i></figcaption>
                    <p>The Software used to process the scan is VXElements, supplied by creaform3d.com and the screen capture shows the outcome of a scan. 
                        The area of beard hair is unmapped in the software as the lasers couldn’t work out what the surface was. This is evident in Fig 4.</p>
                    <img src="/md/laser_scanned_head.png" alt="Laser scanned head">
                    <figcaption><i>Fig 4. - Laser scanned head after software processing.</i></figcaption>
                    <p>The HandySCAN is more suited to scanning of manufactured parts with clear surfaces such as cars and aircraft.
                    <i>Fig. 4</i> demonstrates the limitations of the HandySCAN but also the incredible detail of the areas where the laser can detect. 
                    Based on the results of this experiment, this device would be unsuitable for this project without a lot of editing in a sculpting package, such as Blender, due to the amount of surface detail that is missing.</P>
                    <p>In comparison to the HandySCAN, the Artec Eva 3D scanner (https://www.artec3d.com, no date), is designed with modelling medium sized objects and is compatible with human skin, which is a well publicised feature on their website <i><a href="https://www.artec3d.com/cases/medical">Artec3d.com</a></i>. 
                        Unlike the HandySCAN using lasers to measure and map features, 
                        Artec Eva 3D uses light and photogrammetry to map the object. This method allows for software to use algorithms to “Stitch” the image together into a solid object and requires no markers to locate itself.</p>
                    <p>The benefit to the Artec Eva 3D for modelling a skin based object is its ability to handle different textures such as hair. 
                        <i>Fig. 5</i> is an image of a post processed scan. In comparison to <i>Fig. 4</i> there are no areas the scanner has been unable to map.</p>
                    <img src="/md/artec_3d_postprocessing.png" alt="artec 3d postprocessing">
                    <figcaption><i>Fig 5. - Artec Eva 3D after processing.</i></figcaption>
                    <p>The detail is remarkable. The hair has been handled well as reflectected in the overall model. 
                        It would be best to remove the bumps where the hair is present as this would make it easier to work with as a physical model.
                    To achieve this, a software package would be required. Blender is an option and will be discussed futher in the 
                    <b>Software Selection</b> portion of this portfolio along with an alternative method.</p>
                    <p>
                    Another reverse engineering technique is Motion Capture which can generate movements into a 3 dimentional virtual models. 
                    This is a popular technology used in animated films. 
                    Warner Bros. used Motion capture for The Polar Express released in 2004 which is reviewed by Mark Harrisons (2020) review in <a href= "https://www.filmstories.co.uk/features/revisiting-the-performance-capture-animated-films-of-robert-zemeckis/">filmstories.co.uk</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Motion Capture would be very useful for replicating the authors mouth movements or facial expressions, 
                    but this is beyond the scope of this artifact as the cost of making a model thats capable of producing the motions required for facial expressions.

                        The software package required for processing images from Artec Eva 3D exports as .stl file format. This is a standard format for 3d file which is abbreviated from Standard Triangle Format or Standard Tessellation Format, depending on the source.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        When working with the .stl file generated by the Artec Eva 3D, it is possible to import <i>Fig.5</i> directly into a CAD package such as Fusion 360 or Autocad. These types of CAD packages are best used for manufacturing of components like the Stand and hinge required for creating an opening at the back of the head as.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        As previously mentioned, Blender would be a better choice for manipulation of a model like the head due to its built in sculpting tools <a href="https://www.blender.org/features/sculpting/">blender.org</a> (no date). 
                        Another advantage of using Blender is its open source licensing.
                        Blender takes a bit of getting used to but it is possible to use the brushes to smoothen an area and cutting tools for creating eyes which is a better method than trying to use CAD packages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Touch sensitive devices which provide Haptic feedback could have also been an option for sculpting, <a href="https://www.3dsystems.com/haptics-devices/touch-x">3dsystems.com</a>. 
                        The Touch X is one of which the author has been trained on. A good use case for these types of devices is the training of surgeons. 
                        They provide feedback to the operator about pressure and surface contact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Haptic devices can be used for robotic control, collison detection, mapping and more. For this project, Blender was used instead of a Haptic Pen for its simplicity and the software was easily installed and used without the need for specialist peripherals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The haptic pen could have been used to touch up the model but blender was a preferred package as its tools are more familiar.

                            There are a number of options for manufacturing a prototype depending on the budget and project requirements. 
                            3d printers using Poly(lactic acid) or PLA for short, are a popular choice. 
                            The method requires the material to be heated and layered on top of itself. 
                            It is strong and can create complex srtructures(Sandip Kumar Mishra et al, 2021).

                            It is a lower end of the range of 3d Printers available on the market with a retail price of around £210 on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creality-Official-Meanwell-Flexible-220x220x250mm/dp/B07GYRQVYV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=ender+3+pro&qid=1680867612&sprefix=ender%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1">amazon.co.uk</a>.
                            The detail the printer is able to achieve is very good, The head in <i>Fig. 6</i> shows the contours in the skin that the scanner was able to map. 
                            The over hanging areas required the printer to add support structures seen on the ear and eyes.

                            <p>
                            Because the printed scan has been so successful and the detail achieved is remarkable, 
                            This method of prototype manufacturing has proven to be the best option.

                            Laser cutting was considered but this type of manufacturing technique is better for flat structures that dont require the detail of a face. 
                            A laser cutter would be an option for creating a baseplate using wood or Acrylic. 
                            Using these materials and cutting technique, 3D structures can be made by cutting multiple sections.

                        A latex or resin material could make the appearance of the model more "Human Like". there are some great examples of Robotic applications which are nearly identical to the humans they were modelled on. 
                        One such example is Germinoid F (https://techresearchonline.com/, 2022), pictured in Fig 7 below, which is based on a twenty year old. It is possible to colour match the pigment of skin using a dye at the time of mixing, Which Fig 7 demonstrates how accurate the colours can be mixed to match a real humans skin pigment.

                        Latex or rubber is flexible enough for designers to use methods like wires attached to servos to create facial expressions and movements which replicate a human face. 
                        This would require a different approach to the design process.<br>
                        As the head is a top down design generating a solid prototype, it would be less suitable to try and use a technique such as rubber silicon, 
                        as casting a silicon mold over the head would require the removal of the ears and nose from the 3d printed head to allow the set cast to be removed.<br>
                        If a further prototype were commissioned, this would be an option if considered from the outset and the budget permitted its use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        As the final 3D print pictured in <i>Fig 8</i> has retained a high quality of detail as can be observed around the eyes which are clearly of a tired and stressed Final Year Student, 
                        it would be a shame to lose this level of detail by adding a thicker material which would deminish.
                        Another method which may be more suitable for the head prototype would be to spray it. 
                        This would retain the detail and create a nice finish.

                                Before applying the paint skin finish the printed head needs:<br>
                                    <li>The access panels need to be cut from the back of the head</li>
                                    <li>Two door sections cutting out the back of the head.</li>

                                <br>
                                in Fig.9, the head is divided up based on the centre point from the back of the ears.
                                The panels are then measured out based on a fixed distance from the centre line.

                                Once the lines were finalised, the panels were cut using a dremmel seen in Fig.10.
                                <p>

                                A dremmel is the perfect tool for cutting materials such as PLA however, it does have some drawbacks.
                                If the dremmel is too fast, heat friction is generated and can melt the PLA or split along the print layers.
                                Fig.11 demonstrates the misformations the dremmel cuts can cause. 
                                The best option is to cut and smothen them using 80 or 120 grit sandpaper.
                                <p>

                                With the two panels smoothened, it is possible to see what spacing has been caused by the dremmel. This can be seen in fig 12.
                                where the centre join is unable to touch at the bottom and near top of the panel. There are methods to fix this and create a better looking join.
                                these are demonstrated further along in the project.

                                Fig 13. is the back of the head with the panels in place. It can be seen from this angle that during the cutting process,
                                the intended cut line could not be acheived. This highlighted a flaw in our intended plan. A dremmel is capable of cutting and finishing but in this instance
                                it was too difficult to get a nice curved line using cutting disks. It also caused an issue cutting along the same axis as the print layer. This is potentially caused by the print layers having a weaker adhesion.
                                The panels were cut lower down but a change in size was made and a straight cut proved successful.

                                To repair the damaged section discussed above, a workshop technician suggested a body filler called UPol easy 1. pictured in Material 1 below.
                                It is a deep filler which is a good choice for repairing gaps such as the ones caused by the dremmel.
                                This type of filler is putty like and only sets hard when mixed with the activation agent supplied.
                                Once the filler and agent are mixed, it takes around 15 minutes to set. 
                                <p>

                                Using the filler pictured in Material 1. the repaired section of the head is shown in Fig 14. below. after the filler is applied to the gaps on both sides, it hardens and further sanding and smoothening is required.
                                Using a finer grid of sandpaper will create a better looking join when the finishing touches are applied, a 120grit paper is suitable.

                                Repeating the steps in Fig 14. will mend the edges around the panels where the dremmel has been. As the filler would rejoin the panel to the head, a static tape(shown in green) was used to prevent adhesion.
                                This is applied to the one side whilst the filler is setting. The process is then switched to the opposite side to ensure a nice looking join is created.

                                </p>
                                To fix the centre join, the static tape is applied in the same way as the other joins, but thius time the other joins needed to be taped with a black insulation tape to hold the panels still.
                                Too much movement could have caused inperfections to the doors ability to close. Working with freely moving parts and one pair of hands is tricky in a confined space like inside the head.
                                In Fig 16b. the centre join is displayed with the filler applied. The 3d printer created a layer to a single point. these layers start to form like contours towards the end of a print with this typ of geometric shapes which are visable in Fig 16a.
                                Sanding these contours would only remove some of the detail but may also weaken the top of the head. The filler is a good solution to create the smooth texture and hide the 3d print layers from the eye.

                         Now the head has been finished, the last step is to design the hinge. This type of product design is best suited for a CAD
                         package, such as Fusion 360, which was discussed in <a href="#software-selection">Software Selection</a> portion of this portfolio.
                         Having the head already in its physical form will help to design the type of suitable hinge structure. 
                         The original plan was to print the head to a 1:1 ratio. This was scaled back to a 30% reduction which is the maximum print size of the Creality Ender 3 Pro.

                       Having taken this project from a concept through to development of a working prototype, there have been areas where lessons have been learned.
                       On reflection, the 3D printed model worked exceptionally well, and after the initial model was created, it can be replicated with a simple build sequence.
                       If the head became a sought after project and started to sell in the millions, 3d printing might not be the way to go. resin or vacumm forming could be another option.
                       Further improvements could be made to the hinge and mechanism to make it attach to the body and join rather than as a freestanding structure, 
                       which would create more space in the inner structure for better speakers a potential power supply.
                       Further to a better design of hinge, a set of moving eyes were developed but not used in this version.

                       These eyes could be developed to move with a servo and potentially in time with music, for extra fun.
                       
                       By 3d printing a prototype and using commercially available resources, such as body filler and Halfords stocked primer and paint, has proven a viable solution
                       using industrial grade products.
